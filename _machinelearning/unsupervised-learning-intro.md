Unsupervised learning aims at **learning some underlying hidden
structure of the data when we don't have the labels**.

Unsupervised models can be used as a pre step for supervised learning,
e.g.:

- reduce the training sample (dimensionality reduction: forward
selection, PCA, autoencoders)

- give output for unlabeled data (clustering, autoencoders)

- grow the training sample (generative models)
